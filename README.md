#DarkSky Client

This is a React + Flux application that connects to my "DarkSkyMongoApi" service.
This project is using babel so that I can write in ES6 along with pre-commit 
and eslint to make sure I follow some standards.

I have used the following:
- FLux _2_
- Node.js _6.9.1_
- eslint _3.11_
- pre-commit _1.1.3_
- Babel _6_
